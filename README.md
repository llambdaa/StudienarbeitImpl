This is a research project for my Bachelor's CS degree. Technically... I have to do it. But the topic was
my choice and thus it was done with a lot of love! If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to
tell me!

| :warning: | Contributions from others are not accepted for now. The project is formally still running and I later have to assure that I have done the work myself! After my studies, the project will be open for collaboration! |

## About
Initially, this project was intended for generation of so-called [Low Poly Art](https://www.google.com/search?q=low+poly+art) from a given image - hence the name **plygn**. However, as that functionality was implemented, it became apparent that by approximating an image using triangles, data redundancy is
generated, because all pixels in a triangle have the same color. That redundancy could then be picked up by various image compression
algorithms (or formats) to compress the image even more.

<!-- Images -->
<!-- Benchmark results -->
<!-- Works even on small images, but less good -->
<!-- Works for every compression algorithm, because they leverage data redundancy -->

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation (Linux)
Clone this repository and install multiple dependencies:
```
git clone git@github.com:llambdaa/plygn.git && cd plygn
```
```
sudo apt-get install python3.10 python3-pip
sudo pip3 install argparse opencv-python rawpy numpy numba faiss plotly qoi
```
The first execution will be slow. That is, because [numba](https://github.com/numba/numba) compiles some parts of the script
and caches them on your machine. <br> After that, execution will be considerably faster than before.
